                        personally. For detailed information on data protection, please refer to the privacy notice set
                        out below.</p>

                    <h3>Data Collection on This Website</h3>
                    <h4>Who is responsible for data collection on this website?</h4>
                    <p>Data on this website is processed by the website operator. The operator’s contact details can be
                        found in the section “Note on the Controller” in this privacy notice.</p>

                    <h4>How do we collect your data?</h4>
                    <p>Some data is collected when you provide it to us. This may, for example, be data you enter into a
                        contact form.</p>
                    <p>Other data is collected automatically—or with your consent—by our IT systems when you visit the
                        website. This primarily includes technical data (e.g., the browser and operating system used or
                        the time the page was accessed). The collection of this data occurs automatically as soon as you
                        enter this website.</p>

                    <h4>What do we use your data for?</h4>
                    <p>Part of the data is collected to ensure error-free provision of the website. Other data may be
                        used to analyze your user behavior. Where this website is used to enter into or initiate
                        contracts, the transmitted data is also processed for contract offers, orders, or other
                        inquiries related to assignments.</p>

                    <h4>What rights do you have regarding your data?</h4>
                    <p>You have the right at any time to obtain free information about the origin, recipients, and
                        purpose of your stored personal data. You also have the right to request the correction or
                        deletion of this data. If you have given consent to data processing, you may withdraw that
                        consent at any time with future effect. You also have the right, under certain circumstances, to
                        request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. Furthermore, you have the right
                        to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.</p>
                    <p>You can contact us at any time about this or if you have further questions on the subject of data
                        protection.</p>

                    <h2>2. General Notes and Mandatory Information</h2>
                    <h3>Data Protection</h3>
                    <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat
                        your personal data confidentially and in accordance with applicable data protection laws as well
                        as this privacy notice.</p>
                    <p>When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data is information that
                        can be used to identify you personally. This privacy notice explains what data we collect and
                        what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.</p>
                    <p>Please note that transmitting data over the internet (for example, when communicating by email)
                        may involve security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data against access by third
                        parties is not possible.</p>

                    <h3>Note on the Controller</h3>
                    <p>The controller responsible for data processing on this website is:</p>
                    <p>Sebastian Hedwig<br>Moselstraße 3<br>6539 Flörsheim am Main</p>
                    <p>Phone: 0151 23456789<br>Email: sebastian.hedwig@web.de</p>
                    <p>The controller is the natural or legal person who, alone or jointly with others, determines the
                        purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p>

                    <h3>Storage Period</h3>
                    <p>Unless a more specific storage period is specified in this privacy notice, your personal data
                        will remain with us until the purpose for the data processing no longer applies. If you assert a
                        legitimate deletion request or withdraw your consent to processing, your data will be deleted
                        unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., statutory
                        retention periods); in the latter case, deletion will occur after these reasons no longer apply.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Legal Bases for Processing on This Website</h3>
                    <p>Where you have given consent to processing, we process your personal data on the basis of that
                        consent. Where your data is required to fulfill a contract or to carry out pre-contractual
                        measures, we process your data on that basis. We also process your data where necessary to
                        comply with legal obligations or based on our legitimate interests, provided your interests and
                        fundamental rights do not override those interests. If you have consented to the storage of
                        cookies or access to information on your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), processing is
                        additionally based on your consent, which you may withdraw at any time. The relevant legal basis
                        applicable in each case is outlined in the specific sections of this privacy notice.</p>

                    <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
                    <p>In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. This may require
                        the transfer of personal data to those external parties. We only share personal data with
                        external parties where necessary for contract performance, where we are legally required to do
                        so (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), where we have a legitimate interest in the
                        transfer, or where another legal basis permits the transfer. When using processors, we only
                        share our customers’ personal data on the basis of a valid data processing agreement. In the
                        case of joint processing, an agreement on joint responsibility is concluded.</p>

                    <h3>Withdrawal of Your Consent to Processing</h3>
                    <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You may withdraw any
                        consent you have already given at any time. The lawfulness of the processing carried out prior
                        to the withdrawal remains unaffected by the withdrawal.</p>

                    <h3>Right to Object to Processing in Particular Cases and to Direct Marketing</h3>
                    <p>IF PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OR IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST, YOU
                        HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME, ON GROUNDS RELATING TO YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, TO OBJECT TO THE
                        PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THOSE GROUNDS. THE
                        SPECIFIC LEGAL BASES ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED ARE SET OUT IN THIS PRIVACY NOTICE. IF YOU
                        OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA CONCERNED UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE
                        COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND
                        FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE ESTABLISHMENT, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS.</p>
                    <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT
                        AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO
                        APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR
                        PERSONAL DATA WILL THEREAFTER NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES.</p>

                    <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority</h3>
                    <p>In the event of violations of applicable data protection law, affected individuals have the right
                        to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their
                        habitual residence, place of work, or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a
                        complaint exists without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>

                    <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to receive data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or
                        in fulfillment of a contract in a commonly used, machine-readable format, or to have it
                        transmitted to a third party. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another
                        controller, this will only be done where technically feasible.</p>

                    <h3>Access, Rectification, and Deletion</h3>
                    <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to obtain
                        information free of charge about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the
                        purpose of the data processing, and, where applicable, the right to rectification or deletion of
                        this data. You can contact us at any time regarding this or if you have further questions about
                        personal data.</p>

                    <h3>Right to Restrict Processing</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can
                        contact us at any time to exercise this right. The right to restrict processing applies in the
                        following cases:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you contest the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to
                            verify this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the
                            restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
                        <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you may request the restriction of
                            data processing instead of deletion.</li>
                        <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the establishment, exercise, or
                            defense of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of
                            your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
                        <li>If you have objected to processing, a balancing of your interests and ours must be carried
                            out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right
                            to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, such data—apart from being
                        stored—may only be processed with your consent, for the establishment, exercise, or defense of
                        legal claims, to protect the rights of another natural or legal person, or for reasons of
                        important public interest.</p>
